#### Me ####

Hello, I'm a **software architect** and **developer** in a wide variety of applications but my *current* focus is on web applications because designing and building scalable, distributed applications on the cloud is challenging and challenge is *fun!*

Altough i have **9 years of professional experience**, I have never worked a single day of my life. I *love* programming, heck, I've been programming since I was 9 years old, it's my main hobby and my stress reliever, sometimes even my obsession and always an argument with my girlfriend. That's why i'm looking for a dynamic and young environment with passionate people like me, smart people i could learn from.

The first line of code I've written was in **BASIC**, but i quickly moved to **C** and **ASM** because I wanted to develop my own operating system <dfn>(monolithic kernel, single-threaded, bootloader and a basic filesystem)</dfn>, later i switched to **C++** because i felt it was more appropriate for writing **3D engines** for games, I worked for a year using **DirectX** then moved to **OpenGL** because i wanted to try something new and loved it, I've used it for years. But writing a 3d game is a huge task for a single person and I got lost when rolling my own script language <dfn>(stack-based VM, event driven, C like syntax, configurable EBNF grammar)</dfn> using, of course, **boost::spirit**.

#### Job 0 ####

My first job (<abbr title="Milo S.a.s, Modena, Italy">Milo, 2003-2004</abbr>) at the age of 17 had me involved as the **lead developer** of a **real time debugger** for microcontrollers <dfn>(USB, RS-232, GPS tracking system)</dfn> using **C and C++**.

#### Job 1 ####

Then i got my second job (<abbr title="Expert System S.p.a., Modena, Italy">Expert System, 2004-2010</abbr>), wich introduced me to **Semantics and Linguistics**. Still today **Natural Language Processing** along with **Information Retrieval** are two of my interests. I've succesfully delivered a wide range of server and client applications for the **Windows** and **Linux** platforms using mainly **C++**, **MFC**, **boost** and later **C#**. My love for algorithms and data structures plus my obsessive perfectionism pushed me to came up with my own take on prefix trees for fast dictionary lookup.

Meanwhile in My Spare Time my focus shifted forth and back between **games development**, **OS development** and **drivers development** (Linux and Windows) but in **2008** i revamped my **HTML** skills and settled on web development. My interest about the web introduced me to **PHP** and **Javascript** in the early days of DHTML, but the languages of choice this time were **C#** <dfn>(ASP.net, ASP.net MVC)</dfn> and **Python** <dfn>(AppEngine, Django)</dfn>.

#### Job 2 ####

Web development slowly became my main hobby and I got job offer (<abbr title="Yoox S.p.a., Bologna, Italy">Yoox, 2010-</abbr>) that I accepted. My current job consists mainly in **SoA** and **web APIs** design on the **Microsoft stack** <dfn>ASP.net MVC, C#</dfn>, I'm in charge of architecturing and developing **distributed** applications in **C#** and **.net Framework 3.5/4.0** that are succesfully handling billions of requests per day. Scrum is part of my daily routine but I'm used to XP and KanBan too. We approach software development mainly with **<acronym title="Test Driven Development">TDD</acronym>** and **<acronym title="Behavior Driven Development">BDD</acronym>**, always in continuous integration.

But my current nightly builds are for a web app that uses technologies such as **Tornado**, **Node.js**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, **RabbitMQ** and **Memcached** running on **Amazon AWS**, moving away from **AppEngine** after 2 years of experience. In the choice of a stack i opted to have as many movable parts as possibile, the more heterogeneous the better; this is usually a mistake for production applications but my choice was based on the fact that there is a lot to learn this way, and learning is *fun!*

Altough I'm still studying at the University of Bologna, my CS background is strong.
